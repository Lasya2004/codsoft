          <p>
            I am Lasya, a third-year engineering student specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my technical skills in several programming languages and web development technologies, including C, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS.

My proficiency in C and C++ has provided me with a solid foundation in programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and efficient coding practices. These skills are critical for embedded systems and hardware programming, which are integral components of ECE.

Additionally, my knowledge of Python has expanded my capabilities in data analysis, automation, and scripting. Python's versatility and extensive libraries have allowed me to work on various projects ranging from simple automation scripts to complex data analysis tasks.

Furthermore, my expertise in HTML and CSS enables me to design and develop dynamic and responsive web pages. These skills complement my understanding of user interface design and user experience, which are essential for creating interactive and user-friendly web applications.

As an engineering student, I am passionate about leveraging these skills to contribute to innovative projects and solve real-world problems. I am eager to apply my knowledge in practical settings, collaborate with peers and professionals, and continuously learn and grow in the field of ECE.
